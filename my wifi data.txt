Analysis of Your Device's Default Buffer Sizes

1️⃣ TCP Receive Buffer (tcp_rmem):

2097152  4194304  8388608

Min: 2 MB

Default: 4 MB

Max: 8 MB

✅ Good for stable connections.


2️⃣ TCP Send Buffer (tcp_wmem):

262144  524288  1048576

Min: 256 KB

Default: 512 KB

Max: 1 MB

⚠️ A bit low for high-speed networks. Increasing may improve upload performance.


3️⃣ Max Receive Buffer (rmem_max):

16777216 → 16 MB

✅ Very high, great for fast downloads.


4️⃣ Max Send Buffer (wmem_max):

8388608 → 8 MB

✅ Good, but can be increased if needed.

Suggestions for Performance Boost (Optional)

If you want to increase buffer sizes for faster network speeds:

adb shell sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_rmem="4096 87380 16777216"
adb shell sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_wmem="4096 65536 16777216"
adb shell sysctl -w net.core.rmem_max=16777216
adb shell sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=16777216

⚠️ These require root access. Without root, you can only check values, not modify them.

Your current settings are already optimized, except for TCP send buffer (tcp_wmem). If you face slow upload speeds, that’s where you might need an increase.
